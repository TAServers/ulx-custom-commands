# ulx-custom-commands
A fork from the original Ulx Custom Commands, it has been modified to follow Tas needs therefore most of the unnecessary things have been removed, if there's any issue or you need help with contributing, please create an issue or a post in discussions.
## Information
Custom ULX commands was an addon that was first uploaded to the Ulyssesmod.net forums on May 8th, 2014, by a user named Cobalt. The owner has since become inactive on the project, and it grew outdated as time went on. Server owners on Garry's Mod were fond of the addon, so we decided to maintain the code, fix it up, and breathe some new life into it.

## How to Install
Installation is extremely simple. Just click "Clone or download" and select "Download ZIP". After that, extract the ZIP to a folder on your computer and upload it to the /garrysmod/addons directory on your server.
If you're unsure about how to access your server remotely, you should contact your server provider or look up a tutorial for that provider. We won't be able to help you connect remotely to your server, as there are many different hosts and no one-size-fits-all solution.
